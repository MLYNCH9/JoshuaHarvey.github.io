  <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p class= "family" style="text-align: center"> My mom adopted me when I was only 3 months old, I was homeless and begging on street corners for any scraps I could get. I was a cute puppy, so I was able to hustle for all of my meals, but I dreamed of having a home to call my own. One that wasn't the small cardboard box under the freeway - no, I had my sights on a pillow in front of someones fireplace.</p>
